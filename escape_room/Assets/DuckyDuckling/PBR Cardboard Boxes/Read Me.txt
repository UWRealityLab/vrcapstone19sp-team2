Lighting:
    Please ensure you're working in the linear color space when using PBR assets!

    If you're unsure if this is already set, navigate to
    Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings -> Color Space -> linear

    Working in gamma may produce undesireable results.

    For more information, check out Unity's own documentation on the subject.

Performance:
    While the textures are exported in 4096x4096 resolution, it's not advised
    to use this resolution in real-time applications. For props such as these for 
    higher end games, it's generally advised to keep it at 1024x1024 for high-end platforms,
    and 512x512 or even 256x256 for lower-end platforms. Higher resolutions requires both more
    disk space for the end consumer, along with RAM and VRAM. Running low on VRAM can lead to 
    severe stutters.

    To lower the resolution from the original 4096x4096 presentation resolution, navigate to
    ...\Cardboard_Boxes\Textures\CardboardBoxes\*.png and set the Max Size at the bottom of the import
    window to your desired resolution.
