Thanks for purchasing the Old Brick House!

Please make sure to use linear color space! Drop in your FPS controller, make sure its camera tag is set to MainCamera and enjoy exploring the scene!
Raycaster_Interactions class must be present in the scene in order for the house interactions to work. You can open all doors, attic windows, switch all lights and gasheaters on and off.

You might want to set the slopeLimit var for the CharacterController to be 100 when climbing up the trapdoor ladder.

Important: Lighting is baked and configured to work with a properly set up post-processing profile. 

To get production quality looks, download Unity's Post-processing Stack: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912
Use the already configured profile in the 'Demo' folder (Make sure to use deferred rendering path on the camera.)
