Team 2 - Qian Yan, Yifan Xu, Jiwen Wu, Yexiang Shao

## Introduction
For the final project of this course, we are planing to work on creating an escape room VR game. It will be a single player game in which the player is confined in a limited game space filled with interactable game components.

In this game space, which probably will be an office, a living room, etc., player will be able to interact with all sorts of furnitures and electronics to find clues, solve puzzles and eventually get out of the room. We will fully utilize the power of VR to give the player an immerse gaming experience.

On top of the ordinary "search and find", we plan to have (at least) three core puzzles that distinguishes our game from the other game. They are illustrated in more details below.
