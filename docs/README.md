VR ESCAPE ROOM
=============================
Team 2 - Qian Yan, Yifan Xu, Jiwen Wu, Yexiang Shao

## Abstract
This gives a preview of our team's course project and the ultimate goal we wish to achieve by the end of the quarter. This project is designed so that everyone in the team can have something different to work on concurrently and learn various features provided by Unity framework. At the mean time, we also want the project to be interesting, not only yielding a result that is amazing to be played with, but also having a developing process that is enjoyable to us.

## Introduction
For the final project of this course, we are planing to work on creating an escape room VR game. It will be a single player game in which the player is confined in a limited game space filled with interactable game components.

Just like a typical escape room experience, in this confined game space, which probably will be an office, a living room, etc., player will be able to interact with all sorts of furnitures and electronics to find clues, solve puzzles and eventually get out of the room. But what special in this game is that we will fully utilize the power of VR to really give the player an immerse gaming experience like they are playing an escape room in the real life; actually even better with the environment we will be able to create freely with Unity.

For the gameplay, on top of the ordinary "search and find", we plan to have (at least) three core puzzles that distinguishes our game from the other game. They are illustrated in more details below.

## Story line, Narrative
Detective Johnson is tracing a mysterious death of an old millionaire. That was a rainy day, and he was in one of the millionair's chalet alone trying to find anything related to the mysterious death.

The rain went larger and larger and Johnson finally fell asleep on the sofa. When he woke up, he found himself in a dark room...

## Components
### Environment
This is the play ground of the game, the room our player is trapped in. To increase the immersiveness of the game, we want to make it real. This room will be filled with interactly components, like furnitures, decorations and electronics just like a real room. On top of that, 

Most of these components will just be there so that the player will be able to play with and move around to increase the reality of the environment and give the player a basic idea on what kinds of interactions are allowed in this environment. Some hints & clues will also be hidden with these components.

Other components in the environment will be used to reveal the story line and give the player the some information of the environment they are trapped in to increase the imersiveness. For example, instead of giving the player the background of the owner of the house directly through narrative, we can put them on a letter on the table so players can explore it by themselves. Another example will be a window in the room to reveal some of the view outside and raindrops on the window to match the possibly heavy rain background music.

### Player movement
In our game, player will only being able to move like a human using the controller, not through any teleportation which can ruin the immersiveness of the game making it feel unreal.

### Puzzles
#### Flash Light Puzzle
In this game, we want to explore the effect of the limited vision to increase the imersiveness and the thrill of the game. Player will initially only be able to explore the environment through the flash light until they find the switch of the light.

More over, one of the puzzle in the game will be related to the flash light. To solve this puzzle, player needs to turn off the light to see the hints that will be invisible if light is on.

#### Radio Puzzle
Radio Puzzle is basically simulating operating radio devices such as telegraph machines and some other normal radio devices. The expected design would be let the player operate these devices given a hint and find something to get out of the escape room. For example, a player would swtich to and hear from FM 105.3 to gather hints, but it could be more complex than this. The significance of this puzzle is about designing and creating radio devices, and the context could be situated at when world wars happened, as a soldier is trying to send or receive messages with a telegraph machine.

#### Lockpicking
In this puzzle, we want to simulate picking a lock. This will both be a scene in the escape room game, and an educational tutorial too, as lock picking is actually not that easy in real life and we would like to give player a chance to experience lock picking in this game. Controlling lock picking tools with VR controllers can be challenging, so we are thinking of creating a very big lock and big lock picking tools to make things easier. Hopefully, players will be able to pick a lock in real life after playing our game a few times!

## Blog
###Week 1
This week all the group members did Unity tutorial and experienced with some VR/AR devices available for our capstone projects. We also brainstormed our project ideas individually. The tentative project ideas we have are: 
- [ ] making pottery on VR
- [ ] AR/VR drum game
- [ ] VR excape room
- [ ] ...
We evaluated the feasibility of each idea individually and our plan for next week is to discuss our ideas together and hopefully finalize our project.

###Week 2
This week we learned ARcore tutorial and started to discuss our project ideas together. Create team webpage. We listed the pros and cons of our topics and evaluated them. We also did some research on existed projects that are similar to our ideas. We found the projects like VR pottery, Drums Hero, etc. Therefore, we chose to develop a VR excape room with some creative features for our project. After finalizing our project, which is an escape room VR game, we wrote a proposal for it and filled the webpage with our initial project design.
Our plan for next week is to present our project design to the class and start setting environment for our project. After getting familiar with the device we are going to use, we also want to build some initial settings for our project next week.
