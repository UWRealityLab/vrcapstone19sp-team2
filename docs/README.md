## Introduction
For the final project of this course, we are planing to work on creating an escape room VR game. It will be a single player game in which the player is confined in a limited game space filled with interactable game components.

Just like a typical escape room experience, in this confined game space, which probably will be an office, a living room, etc., player will be able to interact with all sorts of furnitures and electronics to find clues, solve puzzles and eventually get out of the room. But what special in this game is that we will fully utilize the power of VR to really give the player an immerse gaming experience like they are playing an escape room in the real life, and even better with the environment we will be able to create freely with Unity.

For the gameplay, on top of the ordinary "search and find", we plan to have (at least) three core puzzles that distinguishes our game from the other game. They are illustrated in more details below.

## Story line, Narrative
(Make A Story)

## Components
### Environment
This is the play ground of the game, the room our player is trapped in. To increase the immersiveness of the game, we want to make it real. This room will be filled with interactly components, like furnitures, decorations and electronics just like a real room. On top of that, 

Most of these components will just be there so that the player will be able to play with and move around to increase the reality of the environment and give the player a basic idea on what kinds of interactions are allowed in this environment. Some hints & clues will also be hidden with these components.

Other components in the environment will be used to reveal the story line and give the player the some information of the environment they are trapped in to increase the imersiveness. For example, instead of giving the player the background of the owner of the house directly through narrative, we can put them on a letter on the table so players can explore it by themselves. Another example will be a window in the room to reveal some of the view outside and raindrops on the window to match the possibly heavy rain background music.
